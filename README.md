## Usage
Make sure you have the necessary packages installed. This project specifically uses the [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4) package. Once you have the necessary packages, open the terminal in your code editing software. Type in the command 'node index.js' and answer the following prompts. Once you have answered all prompts, you will see a message that says "success" logged in the console. Open your newly created README and marvel at how quick and easy it was to use this app!
